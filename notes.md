### Definition (from reactor)
>Reactive programming is an asynchronous programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. This means that it becomes possible to express static (e.g. arrays) or dynamic (e.g. event emitters) data streams with ease via the employed programming language(s).

The reactive programming paradigm is often presented in object-oriented languages as an extension of the Observer design pattern.
