Story Ideas
- It would be cool if I could somehow be able to work in event sourcing into the example that I created.
    - Creating a pod member
        - Adding interests
        - Removing interests
    - Associate with pod
        - Added to
        - Removed from
        - Validation
    - Adding an avatar
    - Look into Command Query Responsibility Segregation, as it applies to event sourcing.
